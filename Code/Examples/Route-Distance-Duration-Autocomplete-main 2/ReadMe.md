# For Google maps and API to work

## You should have an account in Google cloud console.

### After having created billing account, create a key using create credentials.

### Enable appropriate api(s) in the library. For example: maps javascript api, distance api, places api.

### Restrict key by http referrers or by ip. For http referrers use the following format;

__file_url__//Users/Desktop/Route-Distance-Duration/index.html

### Restrict api(s) by selecting them.

Note: any change in restrictions or key would delay the rendering of the map or service. Refresh after a minute or so.

### When you clone or download you need to create a file called mapKey.js with your key. An example is found in mapKeyCopy.js
